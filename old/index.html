              Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements
              of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. It is one of the universal
              cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of
              music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody
              and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter,
              and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic
              qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the
              "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music
              may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music
              is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques
              ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental
              pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental
              accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.

              We will help you learn different instruments so that you can do
              what you want in life.A musical instrument is a device created or
              adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that
              produces sound can be considered a musical instrumentâ€”it is
              through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. A
              person who plays a musical instrument is known as an
              instrumentalist. The history of musical instruments dates to the
              beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have
              been used for rituals, such as a horn to signal success on the
              hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually
              developed composition and performance of melodies for
              entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing
              applications and technologies.

              In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written
              expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When
              music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such
              as the notes of a melody, are notated. Music notation also often
              provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example,
              the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow
              blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre.
              To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of
              music theory, harmony and the performance practice associated with
              a particular song or piece's genre.
